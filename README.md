# Pizza App

The Pizza App runs on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) taking advantage of File-system routing, Static Generation and Server-side Rendering, and API routes.

[Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) components are used for the user interface.

[Formik](https://formik.org/) is used for wiring up forms alongside [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) for schema validation.

## Set Up

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Instructions

- Sign in using test credentials
- Order pizzas on the order page
- View and search through created orders on the order list page
- Delete orders on the order list page
- Sign out of app
